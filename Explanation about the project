Project Name: Classifying Images into Different Categories in Python
Introduction
In this project, I focus on the classification of images into various categories using Python. The primary goal is to develop and implement a machine learning model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories. The project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of results.
