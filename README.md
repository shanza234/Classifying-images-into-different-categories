"Classifying Images into Different Categories in Python":

Libraries and Tools Used

NumPy

Purpose: NumPy is used for numerical operations in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and many mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
Role in the Project: Used for manipulating image data and handling large datasets efficiently.
Pandas

Purpose: Pandas is a library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data.
Role in the Project: While not directly used for image processing, it can be useful for handling and analyzing data related to the images, such as labels and metadata.
Matplotlib

Purpose: Matplotlib is a plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
Role in the Project: Used for creating various charts and visualizations, such as accuracy plots, confusion matrices, and sample image visualizations.
Seaborn

Purpose: Seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
Role in the Project: Used to create more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations, such as heatmaps and distribution plots.
TensorFlow

Purpose: TensorFlow is an open-source library for numerical computation and machine learning. It provides tools for building and training machine learning models, especially deep learning models.
